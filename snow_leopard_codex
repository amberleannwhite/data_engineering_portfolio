# 🐆 Snow Leopard Codex – MySQL Portfolio Project

**Snow Leopard Codex** is a built-from-scratch MySQL relational database designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate core data engineering and database architecture skills.

This project includes:
- Schema design with primary and foreign key constraints
- Seed data insertion
- Relational queries using joins
- A full backup and restore workflow using MySQL CLI tools

The theme is intentionally playful and narrative-driven, while the implementation follows real-world database practices.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- MySQL Server 8.0
- MySQL Shell / MySQL CLI
- Windows Command Prompt
- GitHub

## 🧠 Database Design

### Entities
- **realms** – distinct regions or domains
- **creatures** – entities belonging to realms
- **abilities** – skills or powers
- **creature_abilities** – junction table (many-to-many)

### Relationships
- One realm → many creatures
- Many creatures ↔ many abilities

All relationships are enforced using foreign key constraints.
