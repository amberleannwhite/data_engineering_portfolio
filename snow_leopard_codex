# Snow Leopard Codex (MySQL) — Build-from-Scratch Relational Database

A small portfolio database project built from scratch in MySQL to practice:
- schema design and normalization
- primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
- many-to-many relationships via a junction table
- querying across multiple tables
- backup + restore workflow using `mysqldump`

## Schema Overview

**Tables**
- `realms` — environment metadata (magic density, climate)
- `creatures` — creatures and their home realm
- `abilities` — ability catalog with elemental types
- `creature_abilities` — junction table linking creatures to abilities + acquired level

**Relationships**
- `creatures.realm_id → realms.realm_id` (many creatures to one realm)
- `creature_abilities.creature_id → creatures.creature_id`
- `creature_abilities.ability_id → abilities.ability_id`  
(many-to-many between creatures and abilities)

## Setup (MySQL)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE snow_leopard_codex;
USE snow_leopard_codex;
