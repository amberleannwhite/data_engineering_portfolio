# 🐆 Snow Leopard Codex – MySQL Portfolio Project

**Snow Leopard Codex** is a built-from-scratch MySQL relational database designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate core data engineering and database architecture skills.

This project includes:
- Schema design with primary and foreign key constraints
- Seed data insertion
- Relational queries using joins
- A full backup and restore workflow using MySQL CLI tools

The theme is intentionally playful and narrative-driven, while the implementation follows real-world database practices.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- MySQL Server 8.0
- MySQL Shell / MySQL CLI
- Windows Command Prompt
- GitHub

---

## 🧠 Database Design

### Entities
- **realms** – distinct regions or domains
- **creatures** – entities belonging to realms
- **abilities** – skills or powers
- **creature_abilities** – junction table (many-to-many)

### Relationships
- One realm → many creatures
- Many creatures ↔ many abilities

All relationships are enforced using foreign key constraints.

## 🗂️ Project Files

| File | Description |
|-----|------------|
| `schema.sql` | Database schema with tables and constraints |
| `seed.sql` | Initial data population |
| `queries.sql` | Example queries and joins |
| `backup_restore.md` | Backup & restore workflow notes |

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Create the database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE snow_leopard_codex;
USE snow_leopard_codex;
# Snow Leopard Codex (MySQL) — Build-from-Scratch Relational Database

### 2. Load schema
SOURCE schema.sql;

### 3. Load seed data
SOURCE seed.sql;

### 4. Run queries
SOURCE queries.sql;

💾 Backup & Restore
This project includes a validated backup and restore workflow using:
mysqldump.exe for exporting data
mysql.exe for restoring into a fresh database
See backup_restore.md for exact commands and troubleshooting notes.

🧩 Lessons Learned (Highlights)
Difference between mysqldump (export) and mysql (import)
How USE database; inside dumps can redirect restores
Why restore-friendly dumps matter for portability
How to debug MySQL CLI issues on Windows paths
How to think operationally, not just syntactically

✨ Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates not just SQL syntax, but:
Systems thinking
Debugging real tooling issues
Understanding of database lifecycle operations
Readiness for real-world data engineering tasks
